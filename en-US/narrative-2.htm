                                　　The theme "Mackay's legendary life in Taiwan" was chosen because of our school, Tamkang High School’s deep relationship with Dr. Mackay. Not only was Tamkang High School founded by Mackay's eldest son, Kai Rui Lian (George William Mackay), the school history museum on our campus also houses a lot of historical materials about Dr. Mackay and his family. These first-hand materials were of great help in the enrichment of our website when it came to content. During the process of data collection and interpretation, we also consulted many literature and history workers or teachers who are engaged in the research of Mackay. These experts or teachers enthusiastically shared with us the results of their years of research during the interview, and even had many small stories related to Dr. Mackay to share with us, which was information that was not recorded in general market books or the Internet. It was this kind of information that gave us a more comprehensive understanding of Mackay, so that he is no longer just a character in a history textbook or documents.

                                    　　Contestants who participate in the "International CyberFair" have a responsibility to uphold their mission of introducing the local characteristics of their region to audiences around the world. In the past few months, we have used a series of methods such as data collection, literature research, character interviews, photography, and records to first complete all the data related to Dr. Mackay, while simultaneously organizing our research results gradually. We hope that through the far-reaching influence of the Internet, more people around the world will get to know Mackay and our community better. We strive to complete the content of our website, become the best community ambassador, and promote Mackay's story to more people.

                                    　　Over the past 150 years, many missionaries have come to Taiwan with religious zeal. Among them, non-other identified with Taiwan the most than Pastor Mackay. Not only did he marry a Taiwanese wife, but his two daughter’s hand in marriage were also taken by Taiwanese individuals. When he was 28 years old, he came to Tamsui, and he wrote in his diary: "I was excited when the boat entered Tamsui Harbor, and immediately understood that this was the place to be. No one has ever preached on this land before. Praise the Lord!" He fell in love with Danshui's natural beauty at first sight, a love that continued until he died of throat cancer on June 2, 1901. Dr. Mackay came to Taiwan from Canada and made his home in Tamsui as a base for his missionary work, medical care and education. After untold hardships, he established churches, medical centers and schools. He not only contributed a lot to Tamsui, but also had a great impact on Taiwanese society. The main purpose of this project is to help more people understand Mackay's efforts for his hometown, to help them feel his selfless dedication, learn from his love and sentiment for his work and service, and most importantly, we also hope that more Taiwanese can develop a deeper connection to the land where they grew up on and become a person who truly cares about their hometown through this website.

                                  The reason behind our participation in the "International CyberFair" was mainly because we were inspired and moved by our seniors. They signed up for the "2020 Taiwan Internet Expo Theme" competition last year with the theme of "<a href="http://librarywork.taiwanschoolnet.org/cyberfair2020/tkshsocial/index.htm">Rugby Soul of Tamkang High School</a>", and with it they were awarded the highest placement of the year - the Gold Award.
Because of their outstanding performance, we, the younger generation, yearned for the opportunity that we could one day shine on the stage like our seniors. Despite our ambitions, we encountered many technical issues at first, for we had no idea on how to set up a website, what we would do for the design of the webpages, and how we would produce artistic elements digitally. Just as the situation seemed bleak, our savior for this competition was sent to us by God – Howard Hsu, our senior. The senior not only provided us with professional and technical support, but also selflessly contributed his previous experience on participating in the Taiwan Net Expo competition, feeling that is was his obligation to guide us. He was not only our director when it came to technical operations, but also acted as our guardian angel, who supported us in our time of need. Senior Howard Hsu's care and dedication to us reminded us strongly of Dr. Mackay’s selfless dedication.

                                    　　During the production stage of this project, the archives that we had collected and organized with great effort were accidentally deleted by a team member at one point. This tragedy became one of our most unforgettable memories from our time working on the project. All of us were extremely frustrated when the accident occurred, because it meant that weeks of hard work had just been unraveled in an instant. Fortunately, the incident happened during the early stages of the competition. Although everything had to start from scratch, the instructor told us that we could either continue to spend time complaining and being swallowed by regret, or we could view this accident as a "lesson" and find a way to turn our tragedy into a happy ending. Thanks to the reminder from our teacher, we learned from our mistake, and also developed the good habit of backing up files every time we edit the data.

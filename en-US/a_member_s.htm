      <input2big>　　The international Cyberfair, experienced many twists and turns, from the beginning we did not know how to start, step by step online learning, ask the seniors, day and night to modify the article, the website, the way also experienced a lot of setbacks such as the disappearance of information, team quarrels, etc., but in the end, everyone still worked together to complete the website. This event not only taught me how to write, how to set up a website, but also to do more teamwork, but more importantly, only perseverance can lead us to perfect results.</input2big>

      <input2big>　　As a member of Tamkang High School, Dr. Mackay is important and relevant to our school, which is why we have chose Dr. Mackay's various deeds and related information as the theme of our website. At this International Cyberfair, I am honored to join this team and contribute to it, even if I am only responsible for consulting the literature and writing the text, etc., a small part of this project, but if I am lucky enough to win the award, I will be honored. The difficulties we face in the process sometimes really make people want to give up, whether it is the inexhaustible progress or the shocking news that suddenly needs to participate in the International Cyberfair, it seems that fate is constantly trying to crush us, but I am very happy to have every partner in the team: classmates, teachers, seniors, my mother, they let me continue to fight hard, they made me cling to this, let me feel that I need to complete. The experience learned in the process is a more valuable prize than winning a prize.</input2big>

      <input2big>　　When I first moved to Tamsui, there was a legendary figure who has been mentioned in my life, and that is Dr. Mackay. Dr. Mackay's footprints have traveled all over Northern Taiwan, it is difficult not to let people know, whether it was a hospital or a bronze statue is commemorating his great contributions, even the school I studied in is closely related to Dr. Mackay. Although I know Dr. Mackay as a person, I do not know why people commemorate him, this doubt has always plagued me. At this International Cyberfair, not only can we work with our peers to expand our knowledge, see not only Dr. Mackay's footprints near Tamsui and the facilities to commemorate him, visit various scholars who know Dr. Mackay. And publish the knowledge of our team about Dr. Mackay in the international competition, but also let more people understand the contribution and influence of Dr. Mackay from Taiwan to his death.</input2big>

      <br>
      <input2big>　　Before I joined the team, I had already learned about the goals and contents of this group through several stage results. Because I have been to many churches and memorial buildings set up by Mackay; therefore, I am deeply impressed by the footsteps and historical stories of Mackay. In the learning environment of Tamkang High School, we have always heard about the important influence of Dr. Mackay on the creation of Tamkang, which also makes our choice of this theme have a different significance. And because I had the experience of studying in the United States, I was able to work as a translator at this International Cyberfair and carry forward the spirit and deeds of Mackay to the international page. In the process, what was learned was not only knowledge and historical background stories, but also through team discussions, literature searches, visits monuments, and qualitative interviews, I learned the skills and academic research methods required in a special topic, and deeply experienced the heart of Mackay who sincerely helped Taiwan when he preached in Taiwan and the spirit of Jesus' love for the world.</input2big>

      <input2big>　　As a student who is extremely passionate about everything international issues, I am honored to participate in the team of this International Cyberfair as a translator. English language, as the most important language in nowadays society, is no exception to various international competitions. Is it enough to learn from childhood to adulthood for us to step out of the international world or live in the comfort zone like a frog in the well? However, the challenging task is what I've always envisioned. Since I was a child, Dr. Mackay's story has been deeply imprinted in my heart, and by chance, I came to Tamsui to study in middle school and high school. Tamkang, a living fossil, slept in countless historical events, and Dr. Mackay was one of the important figures who pioneered the whole of Northern Taiwan, not only bringing new religions to the local people but also leading advanced medical technology and different fields of expertise, thus becoming the driving force behind the promotion of Taiwan's leap forward at that time. Dr. Mackay's status in Tamsui is incomparable, from the time he was ridiculed by the masses to this day eternal existence. Today, Dr. Mackay's spirit is still everywhere in Taiwan, and as generations, the only thing we can do is to continue its spirit. Today, I have seized this grossly precious opportunity to bring Taiwan’s unique Dr. Mackay's spirit to the world through the opportunity of the International Cyberfair by blending the uniqueness of Mackay's spirit with my beloved English language.</input2big>

          <input2big>　　This is very important for my university, participating in the International Cyberfair not only let me learn things, but also let me and my friends have a better relationship because we can encounter problems together and then solve them together, but sometimes we will quarrel because of differences of opinions, there is no way to blame anyone because everyone is going to make the website better, so as the saying goes, “the more quarrels and the more feelings”, this sentence is true, and I have met a lot of new friends because of doing the International Cyberfair.</input2big>

      <input2big>　　This time the International Cyberfair, that I have experienced a lot, from the very beginning I did not know anything to now experience uninterrupted online learning, asking the seniors and day and night production (sometimes even noon/night break do not sleep); therefore, lead us to now, during this time, I also learned a lot, like the infrastructure of the website, the use of Dreamweaver and the application of bootstrap, which have benefited me a lot, and also made me more aware of our original principal and the experience in creating this school.</input2big>

      <input2big>　　During this International Cyberfair , I learned a lot of skills in dealing with website editing, format sorting and interviewing, etc., these are rare experiences, in which I also learned how important the division of labor and cooperation is, through the theme of this International Cyberfair is about the life of Mackay, I also learned more about the great deeds of Mackay, many of which are not usually heard of, which broadened my horizons.</input2big>

  			  　<h3><font color="#5e403b">Introduction</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　At this International cyber fair, we invited Dr. Mackay, who has been studying Dr. Mackay for 7 years, to study Dr. Chen Shun Fu at the beginning, saying that he first introduced himself, saying that he had moved from Taipei to Yilan and lived a pastoral life, and later joined the Toucheng Church after moving to Toucheng, because he was curious about how the Toucheng Church was established, and later found that there was a missionary named Mackay, and went to study Mackay.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Why did Dr. Mackay preach in Taiwan?</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　When Mackay was in junior high school, he listened to Pastor William's speech, he was deeply inspired and determined to go to China to preach, and later when he arrived in China, he found that many people had already begun to preach there, and then someone told Mackay that he could go to Formosa, and later came to Taiwan to Takao(Kaohsiung). </input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay went North to Hobe</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　After Mackay came ashore, he asked Rev. Hugh Ritchie where there was no church because Mackay felt that he was a pioneer, and Rev. Hugh Ritchie told Mackay that there was already an English church in the South, and later he took Mackay from Taichung New Society to Tamsui for three days and three nights. After walking from Taichung Taichung City, to Tamsui for three days and three nights, he took Mackay to Tamsui and told Mackay that the places that came all the way up from Taichung were all available, and then Mackay knew that there were so many places for him to assist.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay's encounter in Sino-French War</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　By word of Mr. Chen Shun Fu's mouth, I learned about Mackay during the Sino-French War, when Mackay broke into the battlefield to care about the residents of Toucheng and was arrested by the Qing soldiers, the Qing commander at the time, Liu Ming Chuan, asked Mackay to be brought in, Liu Ming Chuan asked Mackay, what are you here for, Mackay told him that I was going to Yilan to care about whether my disciple were okay, Liu Ming Chuan said Yilan, you absolutely can't go, that side is blocked but Mackay insisted on going over, Liu Ming Chuan had to send 6 Qing soldiers to escort Mackay, but when he arrived at the Keelung coast, the Qing soldiers said that they all had to go back, because all the French navies are in the distance, and then Mackay had to continue walking with his two students, but it did not take long, and he was caught by the French soldiers, Mackay immediately picked up the white flag he had prepared, ready to surrender, Mackay was blindfolded by the white cloth, and walked for a while and also climbed a long rope ladder, after the white cloth was taken down, in front of Mackay was the French commander, the commander asked Mackay what to do, Mackay said that he have to care for the residents of Toucheng, at this time the French commander next to the interpreter told the commander that when he was garrisoned in Tamsui, he saw Mackay preaching in Tamsui and helping the people to see a doctor, the commander only then believed, and called several French soldiers to send Mackay to go halfway through, the French army, they saw a bunch of Qing troops, and then returned when they arrive RueiFang, leaving Mackay and two students walking on foot to Toucheng.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Wherever there was malaria, Mackay went</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　Mr. Chen Shun Fu also said at that time, Guanxi Township, Hsinchu County malaria was serious, and Mackay immediately went to Hsinchu County with Quinine (white potion) to help the villagers, and he also got malaria three times and even almost died, but Mackay still desperately rescued the residents of Hsinchu County.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay's interaction with the aborigines</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　Once Mackay went to the Atayal tribe was called by the chief, the chief knocked on Mackay's chest (representing he are his person), this method saved Mackay's life, once Mackay went to the nearby mountainous area, met a group of aborigines were hunting, Mackay made a chest knocking motion to them, the aborigines were frightened because it was the leader's only motion, and then the aborigines left, but once Mackay's student Xu Rui was hunted by the aborigines in Shitan.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay was hunted when doing his missionary work</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　At that time, when Mackay was going to go to Toucheng to preach, he encountered Atayal hunters down the mountain to come out of the hunting. Mackay with the students’ crazy running and hunters in the back desperately chased, and finally, Mackay brought his students jumped into the Pacific Ocean because the Atayal are mountain tribes can not swim, thus they escaped a disaster. </input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay's events at the British Consulate</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　In the beginning, there were doctors in Britain for the British consulate, Mackay was just a doctor's assistant at that time, and later Mackay studied on his own, observed how British doctors treated others, and later went outside to teach students.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Things people with the same name as Mackay do</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　A captain named Mackay knew Tamsui, Taiwan, and there was a missionary also called Mackay who did so many things in Taiwan, and the captain of the same name, Mackay, donated 2500NT dollars to Mackay to let him have money to build the MacKay Hospital, and the Kay of the Hobe MacKay Hospital was to commemorate this captain. </input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Mrs. Tiu Chhang-min gave a speech</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　Mackay will take Mrs. Tiu Chhang-min with him when he returns to Canada several times, Mackay will go everywhere to do fundraising speeches when he was in Canada, and several times it is Madam Tiu Chhang-min who went up to speak in English, and after the speech, there was a sensation below, and the money raised was more than Mackay.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay's greatest contribution in Taiwan</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　Breaking racial discrimination, gender equality will say these two points because Mackay himself married the indigenous people, Mrs . Tiu Chhang-min is Kavalan, Mackay himself said that he is willing to marry her daughter to the indigenous people, the second point is that he founded the first girls' school called Tamsui Girls' school, so that girls and boys have the same right to study, at that time the students were mostly Kavalan, and also the status of the indigenous people at that time was much more improved.</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">The building nowadays best represents Dr. Mackay</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　Oxford Academy (later became Aletheia University), Hobe MacKay Hospital (Mackay Memorial Hospital)</input2big>
  				<br><br>

  				<h3><font color="#5e403b">The church that Dr. Mackay founded in the North</font></h3>
  				<input2big>　　From the time Dr. Mackay landed in Taiwan to the time he died, there were about 2,000 to 4,000 Christians (4,000 were the number of Christians after his death), and the number of churches founded by Mackay himself in Taiwan was 71.</input2big>

  			  　<h3><font color="#5e403b">Introduction</font></h3>
				<input2big>
				　　For this  International Cyberfair competition, we invited Dr.Chen Shun Fu, who has been  studying Dr. Mackay for 7 years. He introduced himself in the beginning, saying  that he had moved from Taipei to Yilan and lived in the countryside. But he  later joined the Toucheng Church after moving there, because he was curious  about how the Toucheng Church was established, and later found out that there  was a missionary named Mackay, so he went on to study this legend. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Why did Dr. Mackay preach in Taiwan?</font></h3>
                  　　When Mackay was in  junior high school, he listened to Pastor William's speech, he was deeply  inspired and determined to go to China to preach. Later, when he arrived in  China, he discovered that many people were already preaching there, so when  someone told Mackay that he could go to Formosa, he came to Takao(Kaohsiung)  without a doubt. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay went North to Hobe</font></h3>
                  　　After Mackay came  ashore, he asked Rev. Hugh Ritchie where he could go extend the religious  boundaries because Mackay felt that he was a pioneer. Rev. Hugh Ritchie told  Mackay that there was already a Scottish church in the Southern region. He then  took Mackay to Tamsui and told Mackay that the regions between Taichung and  Tamsui were all available, so then Mackay knew that there were so many places  waiting for him to spread the gospel and serve the people. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay's encounter in Sino-French  War</font></h3>
                  　　According to Mr. Chen  Shun Fu, during the Sino-French War, when Mackay broke into the battlefield to  help out the residents of Toucheng, he was arrested by the Qing soldiers. The  Qing commander at the time was Liu Ming Chuan. He ordered Mackay to be brought  in. Liu Ming Chuan asked Mackay what was he doing here, and Mackay told him  that he was going to Yilan help out and check on my disciples. Liu Ming Chuan  told Mackay that he couldn&rsquo;t pass through to Yilan because the side is blocked.  But Mackay insisted on going anyways, so Liu Ming Chuan sent 6 Qing soldiers to  escort Mackay. When he arrived at the Keelung coast, the Qing soldiers suddenly  said that they all had to go back, because the French navy is nearby waiting to  attack. So then Mackay had to continue his trip by walking with his two  students, but it did not take long. In the process, he was caught by the French  soldiers, Mackay immediately picked up the white flag he had prepared, ready to  surrender. Mackay was blindfolded with white cloth, walked for a while, and  also climbed a long rope ladder, after the white cloth was taken down, in front  of Mackay was the French commander. The commander asked Mackay what he was  doing here, Mackay said that he has to help out the residents of Toucheng, at  this time, the translator beside him told the commander that when he was  stationed in Tamsui, he saw Mackay preached in Tamsui and treated the locals.  The commander finally believed him and ordered several French soldiers to  escort Mackay. About halfway through at ReiFang, the French army saw a bunch of  Qing troops and returned, leaving Mackay and two students walking on foot again  to Toucheng. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Wherever there was malaria, Mackay went</font></h3>
                  　　Mr. Chen Shun Fu also  said that, at that time, Guanxi Township in Hsinchu County had a serious  malaria outbreak. Mackay immediately went to Hsinchu County and brought Quinine  (white potion) with him to help the villagers. He also got malaria three times  and almost died because of it, but Mackay still rescued the residents of  Hsinchu County desperately even though it was extremely dangerous. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay's interaction with the  aborigines</font></h3>
                  Mackay once went to the Atayal  tribe and was called by the chief. The chief knocked on Mackay's chest  (representing that he is his person), this little gesture saved Mackay's life  later. One time, Mackay went to the nearby mountainous area and met a group of  aborigines who were hunting. Mackay made a chest knocking motion to them, which  made the aborigines frightened because it was a gesture only the leader would  do, so the aborigines left. However, Mackay's student Xu Rui was once hunted by  the aborigines in Shitan.<br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay was hunted when doing his  missionary work</font></h3>
                  When Mackay was going to Toucheng  to preach, he encountered Atayal hunters who were coming down the mountain to  hunt. Mackay and his student ran for their lives and the hunters chased them  from behind. Luckily, Mackay led his students to jump into the Pacific Ocean.  Because the Atayal are mountain tribes can not swim, they escaped a dangerous  situation.<br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay at the British Consulate</font></h3>
                  　　There were doctors in  the British consulate and Mackay was just an assistant at that time. But Mackay  studied on his own, observed how British doctors treated others, and later went  on to teach students. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">People who are also named &ldquo;Mackay&rdquo; </font></h3>
                  　　A captain named  Mackay donated 2500NT dollars to Dr.Mackay to help build the MacKay Hospital,  and the &ldquo;Kai&rdquo; of the Hobe MacKay Hospital was to commemorate this captain. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Mrs. Tiu Chhang-min gave speeches</font></h3>
                  　　Mackay would took  Mrs. Tiu Chhang-min with him when he returned to Canada. He would travel to  fundraising speeches when he was in Canada, and sometimes it is Madam Tiu  Chhang-min who went up to deliver speeches in English. And after the speech,  the audiences would be amazed, and the money raised would be more than  Mackay&rsquo;s. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">Dr. Mackay's greatest contribution in  Taiwan</font></h3>
                  　　Breaking racial  discrimination, gender equality are the two greatest contributions Mackay  achieved in Taiwan because he himself married an indigenous woman, Mrs . Tiu  Chhang-min, who is from the Kavalan tribe. Mackay said that he was willing to  marry their daughter to the indigenous people. Additionally, he founded the  first girls' school called the Tamsui Girls' school, so that the girls have the  same right as the boys to study, the students were mostly Kavalan then, and  status of the indigenous people at that time was also much more improved. <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">The building that best represents Dr.  Mackay today</font></h3>
                  　　Oxford Academy (later  became Aletheia University), Hobe MacKay Hospital (Mackay Memorial Hospital) <br><br>
                  <h3><font color="#5e403b">The churches Dr. Mackay founded in the  Northern region</font></h3>
                  　　From the time Dr.  Mackay arrived in Taiwan to the time he passed away, the number of Christians  in Taiwan grew from 0 to 4000. And  he also founded 71 churches on his own.<br><br>
